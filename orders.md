# Orders
## In this exercise you should create an orders collection in your mongoDB.


You should at this point have a Cutomer collection and a product collection.    

### In post you should post something like this and post it to http://localhost:3000/orders

````    
  {
    "user" : <ObjectId>,
    "products" : [<ObjectId>, <ObjectId>, <ObjectId>]
  }

````     

And the result in the orders collection in the database should look like [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keanodejs2016/10_store_mongo_db/master/orders.json)
